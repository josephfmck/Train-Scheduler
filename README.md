In this app you can add any train you want and see when it arrives in real time.
In the add train form provided you type in your train's name, destination, first arrival time, and the frequency of when the train arrives. After clicking submit, your train will be added to the schedule and this train's next arrival and minutes away from next arrival will be calculated.
